Assignment: The Wall ERD (with Django)

Refer to wireframe (png provided) and previous wall assignment for basic structure and reproduce with Django models
** after working on this project for a while I received clarified instructions indicating only the model development was required. Pushing incomplete project to repository as I have fulfilled the requirements and need to move onto the next assignment.
----------------------
Original Wall Assignment Instructions

1. Create a wall/forum page where users will be able to post a message and see the message displayed by other users.

2. Store the messages in a table called 'messages' and retrieve the messages from the database.

3. Create a login and registration page that is displayed when a user navigates to 'localhost:5000/'

4. Once the user has logged in successfully redirect them to 'localhost:5000/wall' that will show the wall.

5. Allow users to post comments for any message (store the replies/comments to the message in a separate table called 'comments')


Extra Credit I (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message.
Extra Credit II (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message but only if the message was made in the last 30 minutes.
