Assignment: Email Validation

1. Create an application that asks a user to enter an email address

2. If the email address is not valid, have a notification “Email is not valid!” display on the homepage

3. Once a valid email address is entered, save the email address the user entered to the database

4. On the success page, display all the email addresses entered, along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM) of when each email record was created


Bonus: Allow the user to delete an email record on the success page
