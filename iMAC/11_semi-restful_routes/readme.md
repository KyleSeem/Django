Assignment: Semi-Restful Routes

Refer to the wireframe (png included) and follow the instructions below to build a new Django application:

1. Name controllers/views in plural form (i.e. ‘Products’)
2. Name each model singular (i.e. ‘Product’)
3. Create 7 methods in your view/controller; refer to the routes in the wireframe for guidance
    * index: Display all products
    * show: Display a particular product
    * new: Display a form to create a new product
    * edit: Display a form to update a product
    * create: Process information to create a new product
    * update: Process information from the edit form and update the particular product
    * destroy: Remove a product

This assignment only asks that you build a semi-RESTful application. That’s because we only expect you to use GET and POST verbs (not PUT, PATCH or DELETE).
