Assignment: Ninja Gold (Django Version)

Create a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money!
For this assignment, weâ€™re not using a database. Just save the activity logs in session.
Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.

1. When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold.

2. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold.

3. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or lose up to 50 golds.

4. Use a hidden input tag value in the form to pass the relevant location to the server

5. Have /process_money determine how much gold the user should have

Bonus:
* Refactor your code to remove the hidden input and instead use a route parameter
